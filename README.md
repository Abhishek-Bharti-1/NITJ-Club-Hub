# NITJ CLUB-HUB


For smooth regulation and participation in club activities.

## Issues Faced:

Academic activities have got suitable platforms for smooth conduction of classes but it is not the case with clubs. Mainly Whatsapp is used for the regulation of the clubs. But not an appropriate platform for both operators and participators. It requires making and regulating several groups to accommodate all interested participants just for a single club. Regulators need to be active in all of them. Candidates interested in more than one activity also have to handle multiple groups. Multiple groups +numerous messages results in confusion and time waste. Requires several levels of mediators in between for any announcement (Club groups->CR group
->CR->students).As Whatsapp is not just meant for this hence causes mixing of personal +proffesional chats.

## Solution :

Here we are with a platform solely for handling club activites with the following features:
* Requires your official email id(i.e email id provided by  NIT J) to login. Hence only institute students can access the information.
* One can find all the NITJ clubs on the app and can view the recent updates.
* Posts get arranged as per its upload action timing, hence recent posts can be found on the top. 
* Day, date, time of announcement made also gets mentioned (hence no chance of confusion regarding timing).

## Functationality and Concepts used:
 The app has very simple and user friendly interfacewhich will help the students to get all the updates and the club leads to create and deliver event announcements.
Following are the few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities:
* Constraint Layout : Most of the activities in the app uses flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.
* View Design : Simple and self-explanatory buttons and Edit Text views has been used which makes easier for the students to sign in or log out.App also uses app navigation to switch between different screens.
* RecyclerView : The list of different clubs is efficiently presented by using recyclerview.
* Custom-made UI : The splash screen, login screen, user profile screen, create post screen contains self-designed UI.
  
The app can be used in both landscape and portrait mode.

Database:
 
 Firebase authentication has been used to provide access to only valid users. Firestore database is used to store data. Data is being received in data class which has been put in recyclerview. App has been made efficient by using Intent.put extra(), to view announcements of multiple groups using a single screen.

 ## Upcoming Features & future plans:
  The app is at its very initial stage much more features would be added with time. We have planned to add an authentication system so that only group leads and core members can add any post in order to avoid any fake announcement. The clubs are active on different social media platform so soon the user will all such links in the section of the respective clubs.
